# Beam Coder

[Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) native bindings to [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) with support for asynchronous processing via streams and promises.

The aim of this module is to access to the capabilities of FFmpeg, including muxing, demuxing, encoding, decoding and filtering of media from Node.JS applications. Rather than using the filesystem and controlling the FFmpeg as an external command line process, the beam coder executes functions of the FFmpeg _libav*_ libraries directly. These are configured by Javascript objects and execute over data buffers shared between Javascript and C. Long running media processing operations are asynchronous, running in native code as promises separately from the main event loop. The developers created beam coder to enable highly-scalable frame-by-frame, packet-by-packet media nanoservices built out the web-platform, combining media IO functions with the comprehensive library of other scalable IO modules for Node, such as [express](https://expressjs.com/), [koa](https://koajs.com/), [ioredis](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ioredis) etc..

If you are looking to write your own frame-by-frame transcoder, mixer or muxer, you are in the right place. However, if you want to control FFmpeg as a command line application over complete files or piped streams from a Node.JS application, many other projects are available, such as [fluent-ffmpeg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fluent-ffmpeg). For many applications, such an approach is sufficient and more suitable.

Beam coder will be a cross-platform module for Windows, Mac and Linux. In this early release, only Windows is supported. Other platforms will follow shortly.

Beam coder is the first release of Streampunk Media's _Aerostat_ product set, whereby a fleet of media-oriented _aerostats_ (_blimps_, _air ships_, _zeppelins_ etc.) are launched into the clouds. Media content is beamed between the fleet as if beams of light and beamed to and from locations on the planet surface as required.

## Status, support and further development

Although the architecture of the aerostat beam engine is such that it could be used at scale in production environments, development is not yet complete. In its current state, it is recommended that this software is used in development environments and for building prototypes. Future development will make this more appropriate for production use.

The developers of beam coder aimed to find a balance between being a faithful mapping of FFmpeg to Javascript while creating a Javascript API that is useful and easy to use. This may mean that certain features of FFmpeg are not yet exposed or choices have been made that lead to sub-optimal performance. Areas that are known to need further development and optimisation include:

* shared memory management between Javascript and C;
* hardware acceleration;
* side data and extended data.

Contributions can be made via pull requests and will be considered by the author on their merits. Enhancement requests and bug reports should be raised as github issues. For support, please contact [Streampunk Media](http://www.streampunk.media/).
